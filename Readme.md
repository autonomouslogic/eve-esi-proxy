# EVE ESI Proxy
An HTTP proxy specifically designed for the [ESI API](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/) [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/).

_This project is currently in development.
See the [First version](https://github.com/autonomouslogic/eve-esi-proxy/milestone/1) milestone for progress._

## Features
There are many things you have to keep in mind when working with the ESI, many of which are handled automatically by the proxy,
so you can get on with writing your application and not worry about the minutiae that is the ESI:

* **Cache responses** to disk to improve request times and reduce load on the ESI itself
* _More planned, see milestone_

## Usage
The proxy is easily run from Docker:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8182:8182 autonomouslogic/esi-proxy:latest
```

Then you request data as you would on the ESI, just from localhost instead:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8182/latest/status/
```

## Overhead
The EVE ESI Proxy is built on Helidon, which is a very fast HTTP stack for Java 21.
It's implemented with virtual threads and is non-blocking.
It'll easily handle tens of thousands of requests per second without breaking a sweat.
See [this ticket](https://github.com/autonomouslogic/eve-esi-proxy/issues/23) for some very basic load testing.
